### Practical Application III: Comparing Classifiers

#### Overview 
In this practical application, we explored the data from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79354 contacts.

#### Methodology:
We applied the CRISP-DM framework for understading the data, cleaning data and applying various models for the data.

We started with a basic dummy model and extended basic version of the models like K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Later, fine tuned them further with GridSearchAV hyper tuning paramters.  

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, when compared with train time, train accuracy and test accuracy, we found that SVM (linear) model performed better than other models.
